TODO

- Rewrite plot_samples method to generate a figure that amalgamates all four datasets
    Insert that as Figure 2 in paper and caption

- finish rewrite to make sure everything is working on cuda device rather than cpu

- Rewrite config file/whatever else to loop through datasets and log the dataset num_classes

- write different benchmark metrics and define them in the paper, or just stick with random

- analyze results

- write conclusion
